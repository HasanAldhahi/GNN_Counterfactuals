# GNN_Counterfactuals


## Installation

### Conda

To install the server, you need one of:
- [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) (Recommended)
- [Conda](https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install/)


If installing for the first time you need to create the conda environment:

```bash
conda env create
```

This downloads and installs the required dependencies in an isolated environment (i.e. does not interfere with your
system's installation).

If you already have done the previous step, you might want to update the dependencies.

```bash
conda env update
```

After that you need to activate the environment:

```bash
conda activate gnn
```

Make sure you also activate the conda environment in PyCharm, a guide can be found [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/conda-support-creating-conda-virtual-environment.html).
